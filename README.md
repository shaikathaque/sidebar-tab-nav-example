# About

This React + Vite project is built to evaluate a potential implementation for a web application with a very specific navigation and form layout requirements.

## Running Locally

- Install debendencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- Start project
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Requirements
- Sidebar with sections which can be expanded to reveal menu items
- Unique set of top tabs for each selected menu item
- Form in each tab
- Scale: ability to easily add new form fields, given that most fields will be of similar design and functionality
- Potential to implement a searchbar that will allow to search for individual form fields and navigate to the exact tab where the form field is located
- customization: ability to add one-off form fields with custom design and behavior
